# The Test Code Doesn't Compile

## Protocol

 * [The test compiles now](extendTestWithoutConstraints.md)
 * [I hate this API](iHateThisApi.md)
 
## 

There are only two moves allowed at this point.  If the API
isn't working out for you, then you should abandon the test
and start over while the sunk cost is small.

If the API still seems satisfactory, then use your autocomplete
feature to create _production_ code until the test compiles.

We aren't trying to do anything real at all; this is purely
a race back to the green bar -- simplest thing that could
possibly work.

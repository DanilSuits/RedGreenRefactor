# Bootstrap

## Protocol

* [Create a new Test](bootstrap/createBoilerplate.md)

## Status: GREEN

If you try to run with no tests, that should produce a null result.

## Discussion

Oh man, I hate bootstrapping in TDD.

The dominant activity in the Bootstrap task is to _think_.

From nothing at all, you need to come up with a name for a test
a first constraint to start from, an API to interact with the
system under test, a name for the system under test....

Primary tool here is imagination, and some heuristics.

# Red Green Refactor

Red Green Refactor is the cycle of test driven development.

[![the red-green-refactor cycle](http://marcabraham.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/06_red_green_refactor.jpg)]

In doing some experimenting with [immutable tests](http://cascadefaliure.vocumsineratio.com/2017/07/tdd-and-immutable-tests.html)
I found that the cycle seemed to be a simplification of what was actually going on.

I came to think of the cycle as a game, where the moves you are allowed to make depend
on the current game state.  Which in turn got me to thinking about REST, and hypermedia
and the broad idea that there ought to be an API that describes this design protocol
in detail.
